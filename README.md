# One Arena Gym

This project is based on an actual Gym called One Arena. The goal in building the website is to attract new members and to showcase the gym's 
facilites by way of photos, timetables and introducing the user to each of One Arena's Personal Trainers. 

In keeping with the logo, the style and tone of the website is based around the colour
code the owner chose himself, and I used those colours to best create an online space unique yet familiar to One Arena and it's memebers.

_This is for educational purposes only._

## UX 

### Who is this website for? 

This website is primarily for new memebers who are looking for a local gym but one that has a professional feel to it and a 'straight to the point' attitude.

It also caters to current memebers.
### User Stories 

People who are looking to join a gym but are unsure of which gym might be best.

They might like to:

- *Be introduced to the personal trainers.*
- *See some of the memebers in action (photos etc)*
- *Hear some of the feedback from previous or exsisting memebers.*
- *See if the Gym is also present on social media sites (facebook, instagram, etc)*
- *Check out the timetable and pick a time that best suits them.*
- *Join the Gym via the 'join now' and 'sign up' buttons.*

The website provides:

- *A link to all social media platforms One Arena has.*
- *A contact email address where potenial memebers can open a more formal dialogue.*
- *A Gallery of photos to have a more indepth look into the gym and it's memebers.*
- *A google maps map to facilitate users in easily finding the gym.*
- *A timetable of all available classes.*


## Website Wireframes

### Website pages
    
* All **Wireframes** were originally drawn on paper when I was first designing the 
    website. I wanted to get my ideas into fruition as fast as
    possible and wasn't competent with the sofware.
     The Wireframes below are a copy of those images using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/).

### Testint HTML, CSS and the site

* I used https://validator.w3.org/ to test each page and the CSS.

* I used https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ to test the CSS too.

* I used the 'Audit' option in Google Dev Tools to make sure the site was running efficiently.

* I sent the live link to friends and family members to see if it was mobile ready
    and changed any error one of the users or myself found.

* I tested the site on Google Chrome, FireFox and Internet Explorer.
    Unfortunaly, the site wasn't compatible with Internet Explorer as BootStrap
    isn't supported on it.

* Finally, I used Google Dev Tools to make sure the site was compatible on all the 
    devices listed in their library.
## Deployment 

I created my project on **GitHub** and used **GitPod's** development environment to write my code.

To make my project viewable to others, I deployed my project to **GitHub Pages** with the following process:

    1. I first created the repository inside of my GitHub account using the template given to us by Code Institute.
    2. From there, I launched the project on Gitpod from the repository named *MS1-OneArena*, using Gitpod's Chrome extension.
    3. I pushed all relevant and significant changes to the repository(*MS1-OneArena*), from Gitpod regularly as I worked on it day to day.
    4. Once the project was complete, I opened the 'Settings' section of my project repository in GitHub.
    5. From there, I scrolled to the 'GitHub Pages' section of the 'Settings' page.
    6. Here I selected 'master branch' as my Source.
    7. This deployed my project on GitHub Pages and allowed me to share the live website with others.
